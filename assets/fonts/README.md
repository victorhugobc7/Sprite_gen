# Calamity Font

This folder should contain the Calamity font files:

- `Calamity-Regular.ttf` - Regular weight
- `Calamity-Bold.ttf` - Bold weight

## Where to Get the Font

The Calamity font is from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. You can find fan recreations online.

If the font files are not present, the application will fall back to "Segoe UI" or the system sans-serif font.

## Alternative Fonts

You can also use any other `.ttf` font by:
1. Placing it in this folder
2. Updating the `@font-face` declarations in `index.html`
